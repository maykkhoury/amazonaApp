in desktop app:
(TODO)when creating a garage set its mobile logo
(TODO MAYBE) set the phone number for the mobile app

(TO NOT FORGET) Deliver the DB containing the script that export the tables in CSV
(TO NOT FORGET) get their DB and:
				create the ExportSpecification "MyExportSpecif"
				add the script that export the tables in CSV "Export_to_csv"
